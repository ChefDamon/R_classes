#You are required to produce a scatterplot depicting Life Expectancy (y-axis) and
#Fertility Rate (x-axis) statistics by Country.
#The scatterplot needs to also be categorised by Countriesâ€™ Regions.
#You have been supplied with data for 2 years: 1960 and 2013 and you are required
#to produce a visualisation for each of these years.
#ome data has been provided in a csv file, some - in R vectors. The csv file contains
#combined data for both years. All data manipulations have to be performed in R (not in excel) 
#because this project may be audited at a later stage
#You have also been requested to provide insights into how the two periods compare.
